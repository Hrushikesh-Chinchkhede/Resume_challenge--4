Exciting News: Completed a New Project!

I’m excited to share my latest SQL project, completed as part of a resume project challenge. I would greatly appreciate your feedback on this project!

The Problem Statement:
Atliq Hardwares (a fictional company) is a leading computer hardware manufacturer in India, with a strong international presence.
The management realized they weren’t receiving enough insights to make quick and effective data-driven decisions. To address this, they aim to expand their data analytics team by hiring junior data analysts.

Tony Sharma, the director of data analytics, is looking for candidates with a strong mix of technical and soft skills. He designed a SQL challenge to evaluate both.

 Project Objective:
In this project, I took on the role of a junior data analyst, handling ad-hoc requests, analyzing the provided dataset, and reviewing supporting documents to understand the challenge.
My primary goal was to write efficient SQL queries for each request and extract insights from the query results. These insights will help AtliQ Hardwares make more informed, data-driven decisions.

Here are some key SQL concepts I learned and applied during this challenge:

SELECT, DISTINCT, WHERE clause
HAVING, GROUP BY, AND, IN
ORDER BY, LIMIT
Aggregate functions: MIN(), MAX(), AVG()
COUNT(), ROUND()
CASE-WHEN-THEN
SQL Aliases
JOINS and their types
Subqueries
Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
Window functions: RANK(), PARTITION BY
